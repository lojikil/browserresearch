Browser Research: testing how browser's deal with various items

## Ideas

- Double Cache Control headers: return mutually-exclusive CC headers in controlled order
- public then correct, private then correct, correct then public, and so on
- Automate adding all combinations of Cache Control headers, then doubling up
- Futz around with `Expires` and Pragma
- CSP and the like should be interesting
